### Hi there 👋 I'm Vitalii Markov,

I work with classic machine learning models and handle the entire process: from collecting and preparing data to training models, tracking
metrics, packaging them into production services, and setting up CI/CD for automatic deployment.
I constantly follow the latest ML research and trends to apply the most effective and modern approaches to real
projects. As a hobby, I write ML lectures in simple words, which helps me organize my knowledge. I also write
articles about systematic and rational thinking, exploring cognitive biases and practical decision-making
approaches. I run a blog focused on rational thinking practices.

- ⚡ Your brain is a messy kludge of evolved heuristics, not a truth-seeking machine. If you want to get closer to reality, you have to fight your own wiring.
- 🔍 I'm interested in all things data: **Big Data, Cloud, Machine Learning and Data Science**
- 💬 Talk to me about Games, AI, Rationality, Medicine, Biology(esp. Evolution and Determinism)
